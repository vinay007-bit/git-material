The message you're encountering indicates that GitHub has deprecated the use of password authentication for Git operations as of August 13, 2021. Instead, GitHub recommends using one of the following methods for authentication:

1. **Personal Access Tokens (PAT)**
2. **SSH keys**
3. **OAuth tokens**

Let's go through setting up and using Personal Access Tokens and SSH keys for Git operations.

### Using Personal Access Tokens (PAT)

#### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Generate a Personal Access Token on GitHub**

   - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/).
   - Click on your profile picture in the upper-right corner and select "Settings".
   - In the left sidebar, click on "Developer settings".
   - Click on "Personal access tokens" and then "Tokens (classic)".
   - Click on "Generate new token".
   - Select the scopes/permissions you need (e.g., `repo` for full control of private repositories).
   - Click on "Generate token" at the bottom of the page.
   - Copy the generated token and store it securely. You won't be able to see it again.

2. **Use the Personal Access Token for Git Operations**

   When prompted for a password during `git push`, use the generated token instead of your GitHub password.

   ```bash
   git push https://github.com/username/repository.git
   ```

   You'll be prompted to enter your username and the token as the password.

### Using SSH Keys

#### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Generate an SSH Key**

   If you don't already have an SSH key, you can generate one using the following command:

   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```

   Follow the prompts to save the key to the default location (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519`) and set a passphrase.

2. **Add the SSH Key to the SSH Agent**

   Start the SSH agent in the background and add your SSH key:

   ```bash
   eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
   ```

3. **Add the SSH Key to Your GitHub Account**

   - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/).
   - Click on your profile picture in the upper-right corner and select "Settings".
   - In the left sidebar, click on "SSH and GPG keys".
   - Click on "New SSH key".
   - Provide a title for the key (e.g., "My Laptop SSH Key").
   - Copy the contents of your SSH public key (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`) and paste it into the "Key" field.
   - Click "Add SSH key".

4. **Use the SSH URL for Git Operations**

   Instead of using the HTTPS URL, use the SSH URL:

   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/repository.git
   ```

   Now you can push to the repository without being prompted for a password:

   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

### Summary

- **Personal Access Tokens (PAT)**: Generate a token on GitHub and use it instead of your password for HTTPS Git operations.
- **SSH Keys**: Generate an SSH key, add it to your GitHub account, and use the SSH URL for Git operations.

By following these steps, you should be able to authenticate successfully with GitHub and perform Git operations without encountering the password authentication issue.
