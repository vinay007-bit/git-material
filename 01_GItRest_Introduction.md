# Step-by-Step Guide to Git Reset with Examples

## Introduction

The `git reset` command is a powerful tool in Git that allows you to undo changes in your repository. It can modify the commit history and alter the state of your working directory and staging area. This command is often considered destructive because it can discard commits, which can lead to the loss of changes if not used carefully. In this guide, we will explore how to use `git reset` with its three primary modes: `--soft`, `--mixed`, and `--hard`.

## Understanding Git Reset Modes

- **`--soft`**: This mode resets the commit history but keeps changes in the staging area (index). You can recommit these changes if needed.
- **`--mixed`** (default): This mode resets the commit history and the staging area but keeps changes in your working directory. It allows you to modify and recommit them.
- **`--hard`**: This mode resets the commit history, staging area, and working directory. All changes are discarded, making it the most destructive option.

## Step 1: Prepare Your Environment

Before performing a reset, ensure that your local repository is synchronized with the remote repository. This can be done using the `git pull` command.

```bash
git pull
```

This command fetches and merges changes from the remote repository into your local branch.

## Step 2: View the Commit History

To understand which commit you want to reset to, you need to view your repository’s commit history using the `git log` command.

```bash
git log
```

This will display a list of commits, with each commit identified by a SHA-1 hash. Identify the commit you want to reset to and note its hash.

## Step 3: Perform a Mixed Reset (Default)

Let’s say you want to reset your repository to a specific commit, keeping changes in your working directory but removing them from the staging area.

```bash
git reset <commit_hash>
```

Example:

```bash
git reset fd0c8d3
```

After running this command:
- The commit history will be reset to the specified commit.
- Changes in commits after this commit will be kept in your working directory but unstaged.

To verify the changes:

```bash
git status
```

You will see the files in the working directory as unstaged.

## Step 4: Perform a Soft Reset

If you want to keep the changes both in the working directory and the staging area while resetting the commit history, use the `--soft` option.

```bash
git reset --soft <commit_hash>
```

Example:

```bash
git reset --soft fd0c8d3
```

After running this command:
- The commit history will be reset to the specified commit.
- Changes in the working directory remain staged.

You can immediately recommit these changes if needed:

```bash
git commit -m "Recommitted changes after soft reset"
```

## Step 5: Perform a Hard Reset

For a complete reset, where all changes are discarded and your repository is restored to a previous state, use the `--hard` option.

```bash
git reset --hard <commit_hash>
```

Example:

```bash
git reset --hard fd0c8d3
```

After running this command:
- The commit history, staging area, and working directory are all reset to the specified commit.
- All changes after that commit are lost.

To verify the reset:

```bash
git status
```

You should see that there are no changes in your working directory or staging area.

## Step 6: Reset by a Specific Number of Commits

You can also reset by specifying the number of commits to go back.

```bash
git reset HEAD~<number_of_commits>
```

Example:

```bash
git reset HEAD~5
```

This command resets the last five commits and keeps the changes in the working directory (mixed mode by default).

## Step 7: Synchronize with Remote Repository

If you accidentally perform a reset on a public branch and wish to revert the local changes, you can synchronize your local repository with the remote repository.

```bash
git reset --hard <commit_hash>
git pull
```

This will reset your local branch to match the remote branch.

## Conclusion

The `git reset` command is a powerful tool that can help you undo changes and clean up your commit history. However, it is crucial to use it carefully, especially on public branches, to avoid losing important work. By following this step-by-step guide, you should be able to safely and effectively use `git reset` in your Git workflow.
