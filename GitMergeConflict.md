A Git merge conflict occurs when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences between the changes made in two branches being merged. 
This typically happens when two branches have modified the same part of a file, and Git cannot determine which version to keep. Here's a step-by-step example of how a merge conflict can occur:

### Step-by-Step Example:
Let's assume we have a Git repository with two branches: `master` and `feature`.

1. Create a new Git repository and add some files:
   ```bash
   mkdir merge-conflict-example
   cd merge-conflict-example
   git init
   echo "Line 1" > file.txt
   git add file.txt
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

2. Create a new branch named `feature`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature
   ```

3. Modify `file.txt` in the `feature` branch:
   ```bash
   echo "Line 2" >> file.txt
   git add file.txt
   git commit -m "Add Line 2"
   ```

4. Switch back to the `master` branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout master
   ```

5. Modify `file.txt` in the `master` branch:
   ```bash
   echo "Line 3" >> file.txt
   git add file.txt
   git commit -m "Add Line 3"
   ```

6. Attempt to merge the `feature` branch into `master`:
   ```bash
   git merge feature
   ```

7. Git will encounter a merge conflict because both branches modified the same file. You will see a message like:
   ```
   Auto-merging file.txt
   CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in file.txt
   Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
   ```

8. Open `file.txt` in a text editor. You'll see markers indicating the conflicting changes, like this:
   ```plaintext
   <<<<<<< HEAD
   Line 3
   =======
   Line 2
   >>>>>>> feature
   ```

9. Resolve the conflict by editing the file to keep the desired changes. For example, you might want to keep both changes:
   ```plaintext
   Line 3
   Line 2
   ```

10. After resolving the conflict, add the modified file and commit the changes:
    ```bash
    git add file.txt
    git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict"
    ```

Now, the merge conflict is resolved, and the `master` branch contains both changes from the `feature` branch and the `master` branch.
